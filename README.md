# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The goal of this project is to give new bootcamp students a clean and user friendly webpage to act as a study guide. Coding can be a very daunting subject to learn, especially when first starting out. This guide is meant to help give new students a nudge in the right direction. This will eliminate some of the fumbling around we all had or will have when first starting on our coding journey. 

Although I had a rough understanding of HTML and CSS, I was able to review and put into practice some of the basic principles such as using meta information in th head and determining the class of a section of code so I could use that for the styling of the webpage later on. I also was able to get some much needed review on how to format the code when using styles such as padding and margin spacing. But, the section I learned the most on was in JavaScript. I learned how to define and call a function properly.

In order to use this webpage, first you should open the DevTools console. After that you can go to the console tab to see the JavaScript in action. The script will pick a random topic for any students to study first. No matter which topic is picked, there are notes available on the webpage. Just go to the section that the script picked for you and start studying!
